# JavaScript Error Handling Challenge
In this challenge, you are required to implement a function that performs division and handles potential errors that may occur during the division operation.

## Instructions
1. Implement the `divide` function that takes two numbers as arguments, divides the first number by the second number, and returns the result.
2. Handle the following error cases:
   - If the numbers are not valid numbers, throw an error with the message 'Invalid numbers provided'.
   - If the second number is zero, throw an error with the message 'Cannot divide by zero'.
3. Use try-catch blocks to catch the exceptions and handle the errors accordingly.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to run the tests and validate your solution.
